This is a modified version of Windows Notepad, based on the original source code for
Notepad. It adds a feature which was introduced in Windows 10 - that is, the support
for Unix-style line endings.

Here is an example screenshot of how it works, which is essentially the same as how it
does in Windows 10.

Additionally to the Unix line endings support, NotepadEx converts the XP code-base to
use Vista/7 features, such as task dialogs, common file dialogs (aka "new style open dialog"),
and new style help interface. The old interfaces are used when running on Windows 2000 or XP,
since this software maintains full backwards compatibility with NT 5.x-based OSes.
